# -Designing-the-AHB-APB-bridge-protocol-with-Verilog-for-R-W-transactions-
â—¦ Developed a bridge between high-speed devices and slower peripherals, using an AHB Slave Interface to regulate  hwrite signal pipelining, data bus and address, while the APB Controller used a robust finite state machine to manage  data flow and respond to hwrite and valid signals.
